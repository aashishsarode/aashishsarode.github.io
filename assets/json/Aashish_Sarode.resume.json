This project outlines a Directed Energy mission to the Alpha Centauri star system, our neighboring solar system, as a technological proof of concept and scientific mission. This mission will utilize a laser array to propel a swarm of miniaturized light sail gram-scaled spacecraft into the interstellar medium at a fraction of the speed of light to travel the 25 trillion miles for a journey of approximately 20 years. During the journey, the scientific payload on the light sails will collect groundbreaking data and upon arrival at the Alpha Centauri system, will continue its scientific mission, to provide humanity with a glimpse of what may await us in space. The miniaturization of the scientific payloads, advancements in material science for the development of space worthy structures, along with incorporating efficient radioisotope thermal generators and autonomous operation systems will facilitate the success of this interstellar mission. An assessment of Alpha Centauri system will be conducted as the swarm of spacecraft reaches its destination and a better understanding of the exoplanets in that system will be the result. The questions will be answered as to if we can find another habitable planet for humanity in another solar system using the ancient methods of travel and exploration, a sail and some wind. We will come full circle in our quest to explore and be the first of its kind, not unlike the early explorers that set sail on the seas to find out what was beyond their scope of vision.","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373873398_EXPLRE_-_Directed_Energy_Mission_to_a_Nearby_Star_System"}],"skills":[{"name":"Spacecraft","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Space Systems","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Aerospace Engineering","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Defence","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Engineering Judgment","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Digital Marketing","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"3D Modeling","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Matlab","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Systems Engineering","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"PTC Creo","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Arduino","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Effective Communication","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Engineering","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Team Building","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Arduino IDE","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Aerospace","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"C (Programming Language)","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Raspberry Pi","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Team Management","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Space Design","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"STK","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Teaching","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Python (Programming Language)","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Research Projects","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"LaTeX","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Laser Cutting","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Research","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Oculus","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Programming","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Engineering Drawings","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"3D Modeling Software","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"3D Printing","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"SOLIDWORKS","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Metaverse","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Git","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"C++","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Computer-Aided Design (CAD)","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"MATLAB","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Japanese","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Bitbucket","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"SolidWorks","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Japanese Culture","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Intellectual Property","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Multidisciplinary Analysis","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Blender","level":"","keywords":[]},{"name":"Microsoft Office","level":"","keywords":[]}],"languages":[{"fluency":"Full Professional","language":"English"},{"fluency":"Elementary","language":"French"},{"fluency":"Native Speaker","language":"Hindi"},{"fluency":"Elementary","language":"Japanese"},{"fluency":"Native Speaker","language":"Marathi"}],"interests":[],"references":[{"name":"James Green","reference":"I really enjoyed working with you at the 2023 ISU summer session in Brazil.

One of the drawbacks of this method was communicating with the team to develop very complex systems and waiting for various components to be physically built to move on to the next step. Moreover, the traditional method requires many documents to be shared among the team. So, to eliminate this hectic procedure, concurrent engineering was introduced where anyone within the organization or from inter-organization can come together and solve the complex mission in less time than the traditional method. ESA developed an Open Concurrent Design Tool (OCDT) that has been installed in their Concurrent Design Facility (CDF), which allows for one space to be shared by the different design teams of a space mission. Indeed, the CDF is a state-of-the-art facility where a team of experts from several disciplines designs the space mission. This report discussed how to use the OCDT tool in the CDF lab. To explain the important use of this tool with an example, a space mission is developed for a primary satellite in this report.","url":null,"endDate":"2022-05-31"},{"name":"Tierra-Luna by AstraLoop","startDate":"2022-03-31","summary":"AstraLoop is a transdisciplinary consulting company that aims to enhance space architectural projects’ experience on spatial habitation, sociocultural system studies and space accessibility.
