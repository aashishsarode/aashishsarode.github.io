I'm a PhD candidate in space robotics, with a focus on the application of Quantum Neural Networks to enhance autonomous systems in space exploration. Their research is dedicated to developing advanced algorithms and robotic technologies capable of operating in the extreme and unpredictable conditions of space. By integrating quantum computing with neural networks, I aim to create more efficient, resilient, and intelligent robotic systems for tasks such as planetary exploration, satellite maintenance, and space station operations.

With a background in robotics and artificial intelligence, I has always been passionate about the challenges posed by space environments and the potential for innovation in this field. Their work has the potential to contribute to the future of space exploration, making long-duration missions and deep space exploration more feasible. Beyond their academic pursuits, I'm also involved in collaborative projects with international space agencies and research institutions, ensuring that their work remains at the forefront of space robotics innovation.
