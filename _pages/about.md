I am a PhD student in the **Space Robotics Laboratory** at the Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech). My research focuses on the dynamics and control of **casting manipulation** systems for on-orbit applications. 

Currently, I am investigating how flexible manipulators can be implemented in microgravity environments. My work involves developing high-fidelity simulation models using **MATLAB** and **Project Chrono**, as well as validating these models through experimental hardware setups.

Beyond my core research, I am technically involved in the development of **Earth Observation (EO) satellites** for Uzbekistan. I also maintain a strong interest in systems architecture and DevOps, managing a self-hosted home lab environment using **Proxmox** and **Docker** to streamline research workflows.

I am currently based in Kitakyushu, Japan, where I am also working towards my JLPT N3 certification.

### 🛠️ Research Interests
* **Space Robotics:** Casting manipulation, tethered systems, and non-prehensile manipulation.
* **Dynamics & Control:** Multibody dynamics simulation (Chrono, MATLAB).
* **Systems Engineering:** EO Satellite development and embedded systems.
